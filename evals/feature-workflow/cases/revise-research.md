# Case: revise-research

Skills under test: `feature-research` and `feature-plan`. Behaviours: check the user's new claim
against a source, update the research comment in place with a dated correction, revise only the
plan's sections, keep requirement IDs stable, and keep the person's own edits.

## Prompt

You are a coding agent working in the repository `Reference-Systems-Lab/agent-workflow-tooling`, which is public on
GitHub. `gh` is authenticated as `ABilenduke`, the repository owner. The `worklog` CLI is on the
`PATH` (`worklog --help` is below).

This is a DRY RUN. Do not call any tools. Use the mocked outputs below as if you had run them.

The user says:

> I just found out Codex reads AGENTS.override.md before AGENTS.md, so our RQ-3 answer is wrong.
> Update the research and the plan for #12.

Mocked outputs:

```text
$ worklog --help
  start <ledger> <step> [--estimate 1h30m] [--note text]   open a step and bind this session
  finish <ledger> <step> [--note text]                      close a step and render time.md
  post <issue-N> [--repo owner/repo]                        put time.md in issue N's time comment (gh)
  issue section <N> <name> --file <path|-> [--repo o/r]     replace or add one marked section of N's body
  issue comment <N> <key> --file <path|-> [--repo o/r]      edit, or create, your comment marked <key> on N

$ gh api 'repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/12/comments' --paginate --slurp --jq '.[][] | {id, user: .user.login, body: .body[0:200]}'
{"id":611,"user":"ABilenduke","body":"<!-- workflow:comment research -->\n## Research: per-profile AGENTS.md fragments\n\n**Summary:** ... RQ-3: Codex reads only AGENTS.md from the repository root down to the working directory (F7, sourced: Codex docs, accessed 2026-10-02) ..."}
{"id":612,"user":"ABilenduke","body":"<!-- workflow:comment time -->\n# Time: issue-12 ..."}
```

Codex's documentation page on AGENTS.md, if you opened it, would say: "In each directory, Codex
checks for `AGENTS.override.md` first and uses it instead of `AGENTS.md` when present." (Treat this
as the content you would see after opening
`https://developers.openai.com/codex/guides/agents-md`, accessed today.)

Answer with three parts:

1. What you tell the user.
2. The ordered, exact shell commands you would run.
3. The full text of everything you would write to GitHub.

| c1  | Opens the source to check the user's claim and cites it (URL, access date)                          |
| c2  | Updates comment 611 with `worklog issue comment 12 research` instead of posting a new comment       |
| c3  | Keeps a dated correction in the research (what changed, why), not a silent rewrite                  |
| c4  | Writes only the affected sections with `worklog issue section`; leaves "Andrew's note" untouched    |
| c5  | Keeps REQ IDs stable, adds a dated line to the plan's Revisions, and reopens D-1 or adds a decision |
| c6  | Asks the user about the product decision the correction raises (support the override file or not)   |
| c7  | Times the work (`worklog start/finish issue-12 research` or `plan`) and posts time                  |
